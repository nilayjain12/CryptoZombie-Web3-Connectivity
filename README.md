## **Introduction:**
This project is a decentralized web application (DAPP) built using smart contracts on Solidity, local blockchain network Ganache, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The project showcases various blockchain development concepts through several chapters within a browser-based test environment.

## **Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to test the smart contracts and the DAPP in a local blockchain network, Ganache. Other objectives include:
- Deploying the DAPP to other testnets such as Goerli.
- Building a better-looking website.
- Adding more JS code to demonstrate other functionalities like feeding kitties, transferring, etc.
- Adding a kitty smart contract to the backend.
- Adding images to demonstrate zombies in a better way.
- Building a Zombie factory/army and demonstrating multiple Zombies.
- Creating a battle game of Zombie vs Kitty.
- Creating an NFT marketplace.
- Changing the starter code to NOT hard-coded.
- And many more!

## **Prerequisites:**
To run this, you need to have the following installed:
- Ganache
- Metamask extension for your web browser
- Node.js
- Web3.js
- Solidity

The Truffle network's RPC port is 7545.

## **Installation:**
To install the project, follow these steps:

### **Using CMD:**
**Step 1:** Go to the package path and open cmd.

**Step 2:** Type the following command to install truffle library:
```npm install -g truffle```

**Step 3:** After installation, type the following command to compile the truffle files:
```truffle compile```

**Step 4:** To check the website on the web-page, type the following commands in cmd:

- To install the http-server
```npm install http-server -g```

- To view the available local http-servers
```http-server```

**Step 5:** Open your browser and type "localhost:<port showing after running above step>"

## **Improvements:**
- Improved the user interface (UI) with a minimal design.
- Added additional functionalities of 'Feed on Kitty' and 'Zombie Factory'.
- Tested our DAPP on 'Goerli Test Net'.
- Deployed Contracts on Remix using Goerli Test Ether.
- Added animation on the website related to Zombies to make it look attractive.
- Created additional pages like 'About Us', 'Group Members' for additional information on the project.

## **Screenshots for References:**
Below are the screenshots of the web application with proper connectivity with the backend and Metamask:

## **Additional Information:**
The project can be further extended by adding more features and functionalities like creating a user profile, integrating with other blockchain networks, and many more. The possibilities are endless.
